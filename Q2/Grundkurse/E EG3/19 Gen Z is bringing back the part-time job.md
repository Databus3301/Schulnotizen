# Gen Z is bringing back the part-time job

#### First Sentence

The 2024 article "Gen Z is bringing back the part-time job" written by  Abha Bhattarai and Lauren Kaori Gurley, published in the Washington Post deals with the reciprocal effects of the uproar in teenage part-jobs and the realities of gen-z.



#### Reasons why many teenagers in the USA take part-time jobs 




- "I’m looking for more money to use on myself for me and not get it from my parents." Many teenagers are seeking financial independence, wanting to earn their own money rather than relying on their parents.

- "Employers across the country have taken steps to improve starting pay, which has disproportionately benefited younger workers." 

- "An abundance of jobs, particularly entry-level positions in hospitality and retail, have helped draw teenagers into the labor market." 

- "Inflation has also been a major factor: Students from lower-income families say they’re working to help their parents cover rent and utilities." 


- Flexible Work Schedules: "Employers are so strapped for workers, especially in service jobs, that many say they are increasingly willing to accommodate high-schoolers’ frenetic schedules." Employers are more willing to accommodate teenagers' schedules, making it easier for them to balance work with school and extracurricular activities.
    
- Post-Pandemic Job Availability: "The shock of the covid pandemic changed the picture, at least temporarily." The reopening of businesses after the pandemic created a surge in job openings, which teenagers were eager to fill.
    
- Career Experience and Skills Development: "Kids are realizing they can make money and also get meaningful experience for a career." Teens are increasingly aware of the benefits of gaining work experience that can be valuable for future careers.
    
- Social and Cultural Shifts: "Changing cultural norms." There is a cultural shift where working as a teenager is becoming more normalized and even encouraged.
