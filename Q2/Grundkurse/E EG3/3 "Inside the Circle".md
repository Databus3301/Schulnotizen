# "Inside the Circle"

#### Why I wouldn't like to work at The Circle
Their overly heavy pursuit of work-life balance fails to provide such a balance upon work becoming life. While the benefits of working at The Circle are to be cherished in comparison, they too haven't abandoned the hierarchical capitalist workplace structure of bourgeois and proletariat. I would like to work inside of a worker democracy that can independently decide on such structures, not being forced into believing in *community*. What The Circle hides behind Utopian visions is nothing more than maximising worker output, while lulling the workforce into unquestioning, rule abiding workers sleeping at the company shortening their commute and gaining time to work, and I quote, "just short of overworked" (line 2).
