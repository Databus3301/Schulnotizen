#### Extrapolating present into future
present development | future situation
:-:|:-:
gorwing discrepancy between the rich and the poor | a high wall seperating the rich in the Compund from the pooor living in the "pleebands" (=cities)
growing importance of commercialisation | inescapable advertising
growing fear of crime | "loose change" 
monopolization | OrganInc Compound sneaking into every nook and cranny into your life
people workin at home | no commutes - only modules
rise in mental illness | unbothered increase and active segregation
more govermental control | "fingerprint identity cards" authoritarian 

#### Analysing Dystopian/Utopian features
Utopian | Dystopian
:-:|:-:
bullet trains → a sign of high technological advancenment| sharp divide in between compounds and pleeblands → social inequality 
no commutes → work life or smth. | fingerprint identifying terminals → control and surveilance 
artificially constructed monotony. Controlled by monopoly corporations and media propaganda → easy to keep power (political utopia) | high pollution → ignorant pollution
