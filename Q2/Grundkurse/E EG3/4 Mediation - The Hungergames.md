# Mediation - The Hungergames
#### Write the dystopia fan Pete an e-mail about this article

Hey Pete,

I hope this e-mail finds you in good health. I've read this German 2013 article "Die Tribute von Panem - Catching Fire: Sie zeigt den MÃ¤chtigen den Vogel" published on Spiegel Online, whose heading roughly translates to "The Hungergames - Catching Fire: She give's the powerful the finger", which I figured might pique you'r interest.

The review on Catching Fire, explains it's ordinary but effective world-building, with brutal class structures and Katniss', the protagonist, struggle from the very bottom, through serious, real problems of social and economic nature, to the top threatening those in power with witful weaponry.  

The movie's action loaded scenes take critical stances on reality-TV, enforced loss of individualism and the cultural establishment.

I feel like you'd like this neat film with its smart undertones and dystopian atmosphere.

See you around
Felix
