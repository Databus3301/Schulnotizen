# Stop Killing Women

#### Should "gender apartheid" be made a crime against humanity by the UN?


yes, because | no, because 
:-:|:-:
further sanctions might drain the country of resources forcing it to abide| might not be effective in assisting the undermining of a regime that already faces major sanctions <br> i.e. The Taliban already ignore International Law
pushes other countries to grant asylum | sanctions hitting the wrong people
human rights are actively violated | <sub><s>put integrity of international law at stake</s></sub>
might strengthen other countries to stand up with the fundamentals already in place| 













The comparison between the dismantling of **South African apartheid** under international pressure and the potential effectiveness of addressing **Afghan Taliban gender apartheid** through UN law reveals key differences and similarities. These suggest that the expected outcomes for the Afghan situation are less likely to mirror South Africa's experience. Here’s an analysis:

### **Similarities**

1. **Systemic Oppression**:
    
    - Both South African apartheid and Taliban gender apartheid involve systematic discrimination, segregation, and oppression, targeting racial groups in the former and women in the latter.
2. **Global Condemnation**:
    
    - In both cases, there has been widespread international condemnation. South Africa faced boycotts and sanctions, while the Taliban’s policies are similarly criticized, albeit with less coordinated action.
3. **Role of UN Law**:
    
    - In both instances, international laws and conventions have been leveraged as tools to delegitimize the regimes:
        - South African apartheid was labeled a **crime against humanity** by the UN, leading to global campaigns.
        - The recognition of gender apartheid as a crime would aim to exert similar pressure on the Taliban.

### **Differences in Effectiveness**

1. **Economic and Diplomatic Pressure**:
    
    - **South Africa**:
        - South Africa was deeply integrated into the global economy, relying on trade and investment. Sanctions, boycotts, and divestments (e.g., the sports and cultural boycotts) had a tangible impact on the regime.
    - **Afghanistan**:
        - The Taliban's economy is less dependent on global trade or formal international relationships. Much of their funding comes from narcotics, smuggling, and informal networks, making sanctions less impactful.
2. **Domestic Opposition**:
    
    - **South Africa**:
        - There was strong internal resistance from the African National Congress (ANC) and mass mobilization by oppressed groups, supported by international allies.
    - **Afghanistan**:
        - Internal resistance to the Taliban exists but is fragmented, with limited capacity to mobilize women or challenge the Taliban's control effectively.
3. **Global Priorities**:
    
    - **South Africa**:
        - During the Cold War, dismantling apartheid aligned with the global movement against colonialism and racism, making it a geopolitical priority.
    - **Afghanistan**:
        - Afghanistan is viewed primarily through a security lens (e.g., counterterrorism), with less emphasis on gender rights. Global powers may not prioritize gender apartheid to the same extent.
4. **Regime Legitimacy**:
    
    - **South Africa**:
        - The apartheid regime sought legitimacy as a state actor within international systems, making it susceptible to diplomatic and economic isolation.
    - **Afghanistan**:
        - The Taliban have minimal concern for international legitimacy and often use isolation as propaganda to solidify their control.
5. **Cultural Framing**:
    
    - **South Africa**:
        - Apartheid was condemned as a violation of universal human rights, with racial discrimination widely recognized as unacceptable.
    - **Afghanistan**:
        - The Taliban frame their actions as adherence to cultural and religious norms, which complicates the global narrative and efforts to intervene.

### **Conclusion**

The dismantling of South African apartheid succeeded due to a combination of **economic dependency, internal resistance, and global prioritization**, all of which are weaker or absent in Afghanistan under Taliban rule. While labeling gender apartheid as a crime against humanity is morally significant, the likelihood of achieving comparable success against the Taliban is low without robust internal resistance, unified international pressure, and strategies to disrupt their sources of power.

In essence, the Taliban's resilience to external pressure and their isolationist stance make this situation far more challenging than South Africa’s apartheid.
