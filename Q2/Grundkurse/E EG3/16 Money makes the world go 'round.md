# Money makes the world go 'round

#### Comment - Under the vice of Roddy Doyle's "Filling One's Day"



The saying "money makes the world go round" often highlights the central role of money in our lives. Robby Doyle's "Filling One's Day" touches on this idea and provide a new perspective.

Firstly, while money is undeniably important for meeting basic needs and facilitating economic activities, it doesn't necessarily equate to personal fulfillment. Robby Doly emphasizes the importance of "filling one's day" with meaningful activities, similar to Jimmy Sr, suggesting that personal satisfaction comes from experiences, relationships, and personal growth rather than just financial gain. Money might be the key to unlock some of the things we deem meaningful, but it's not money on it's own that provides the meaning, rather the things it buys us.

On a more broader spectrum of  capitalist theory and especially globalization however, money quite literally makes the world go 'round. Not in a sense of fostering meaning or connection but the ever continued striving for more wealth leading to alienation of, workers from their work and ultimately the products of their work, pushing isolation and ever more focus on _money making the world go 'round_ instead of humans.

To conclude one might say that money quite does make the world go round, but not in the euphemistisch way that the saying might allude to.
