#### Donna Lu - "Diverse sexuality reported by more than on in 10 Australien high school students"

> TASK: what are the results of the survey - what does it find out, what conclusion do the scientist draw

The survey conducted among Australian high school students found that more than 12% of Year 8 pupils identify as gay, bisexual, pansexual, or asexual, while 3.3% identify as gender-diverse. The study highlights an "urgent need" for support services in schools and healthcare settings to address the increased risk of stigma, discrimination, and violence faced by these students. The researchers emphasize the importance of inclusive child health policies and safe environments in schools and healthcare for young adolescents. The study also notes that teens identifying as transgender or non-binary are twice as likely to report having a disability or a mental health diagnosis, pointing to the impact of minority stress due to discrimination and stigma.

>        should be conducted at every school"

Studies on sexual orientation of students have shown a need for adapting our support systems, but should these studies be conducted at every school or would that interfere with students?

While studies on understanding the need of support systems are beneficial to realising and fittingly adapting, they do only marginally contribute to how the actions, experts concluded should be taken, would be implemented, because their main result for many is the sole discovery of these problems rather than their best solution.

Additionally, students should have all the freedom and possibilities for self discovery, which includes talking about queerness and normalising non-heteronormative ways of living, but with many in the midst of their discovery process, still uncomfortable to disclose their Indentiy or even fully closeted to avoid discrimination, a obligatory study at every school would under the current conditions would only contribute to their stress.

Furthermore, implementing mandatory studies in every school could inadvertently lead to privacy concerns, as students may feel pressured to disclose personal information they are not ready to share. This could create an environment of distrust, where students might fear how their data is used or interpreted, potentially leading to further marginalization rather than support.

In conclusion, while understanding the needs of students regarding sexual orientation is crucial for developing effective support systems, it is essential to balance this with respecting students' privacy and comfort. Instead of mandatory studies at every school, a more effective approach might involve voluntary participation, ensuring robust privacy protections, and focusing on creating a supportive environment where students feel safe to express their identities.
