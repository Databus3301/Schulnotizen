# Mediation - Wenn nur das Geld Zählt

Hey Pete,

I recently read an article about the job market in Germany titled "Wenn nur das Geld zählt", which translates to "When it's just the money that counts",  published by the reputable news platform WAZ in 2017, and I thought it might be helpful for you as you consider working there. The article highlighted several interesting aspects of the employment landscape.

In Germany, jobs with higher responsibility, such as air traffic controllers, command significantly higher salaries compared to roles like hairdressers. For example, air traffic controllers earn about three times more than hairdressers, according to statistics from Compensation Partner. This reflects the value placed on the level of responsibility in different professions.

The influence of unions is substantial and varies by industry, playing a crucial role in determining wages within those sectors. Traditional roles, particularly those considered "female jobs" like hairdressing, tend to be less well-paid compared to other professions.

Salary disparities are also evident across different regions in Germany. The western part of the country generally offers higher wages than the eastern part, and the southern regions tend to pay more than the northern ones. This remnant of German reunification is something to consider depending on where you might want to work.

Interestingly, the article points out that some apprentices earn more than university graduates, such as historians, suggesting that vocational training can be a lucrative path.

I hope this gives you a clearer picture of what to expect in the German job market. Let me know if you have any questions or need more details!

Cheers,
Felix








#### Notes
Verantwortung im Beruf:
Fluglotsen mehr verantwortung als Friösre und auch ein drei mal so hohes gehalt
statistik compensation partner.

Macht der Gewerkscahften
gewerkschaften macht je nach berufsfeld bestimmt auch die löhne in diesem

Image und Tradition:
Friseure / "traditionelle frauenjobs" sind schlechter bezahlt

Arbeitsmarktsituation:
Westen verdient mehr als osten, der süden mehr als der Norden

manche auszubildene verdienen mehr als studierte (z.b. historiker)

leute finden ihren job oft nicht nur aufgrund des gehalts sondern auch wegen bewusstsein über die stellenexistenz über verwandte oder familie.

wichtig sind auch eigene skills, einfluss der eltern und alltagsleben





#### Grid_Wave


## General


**Grid Wave** is anti-system program. Originally developed from research done by Langley Microsystems (a sub-developer on the original I-G Net Algorithms) as a company-only tool to test [netspace](https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/The_Net "The Net") integrity, this routine was stolen and "improved" by "vandal" [Netrunners](https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Netrunner "Netrunner"). Simply put, this program attacks the subroutines that make up the I-G Algorithms themselves! By sending out continual waves of netspace distortion that alter the navigation and positional signals of [cyberdecks](https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Cyberdeck "Cyberdeck") and datafortresses alike, it attempts to "burn out" all objects in a cyberspace area. A Grid Wave attack starts from a single square and advances to 10 square radius limit.

Note: occupants and objects in the center square are not initially affected (runner must make a Very Difficult REF roll in order to jackout immediately after launching the program to avoid its effects). If an object in cyberspace (programs, datawalls, codegates, etc.) fails a 50% roll, it is de-rezzed from netspace. A affected netrunner must make a Very Difficult Interface roll to remain jacked-in. Even if he is successful in avoiding being ejected from the net, his icon is shifted to the edge of the area of effect His netspace movement is reduced to 1 for 1D10 net rounds and his Interface ability suffers a 1D6 penalty 1D6 net rounds. The 1 a square radius area cannot be entered for 1D6+4 net rounds (it doesn't exist!) until the local netspace servers rebuild the area.

Warning: use of this program will be immediately picked up by [Net Watch](https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/NetWatch "NetWatch") within an area up to the size of a city subgrid.
