Dear Ikenna,

how have you been? I'm writing this in response to your request of researching to you if Germany is really a perfect place to live. 

I found this article "Wie Au√üerirdische in Deutschland" which translates to "Like Aliens in Germany" by Kosmos interviewing the nigerian psychology professor Erhabor Sunday Idemudia concerning himself with your question. 

Europe and the west are overly glorified by Africans and those who make it are to proud to admit the struggles they faced. Many work lower-class jobs like dish washing and drug dealing or resort to prostitution as a last barricade to working allowanceless poverty. *Idemudia's advocating goverments like Nigeria and Ghana's to provide better job opportunities for their people as not to provoke this flight in the first place.* He also goes on to talk about movements of the political right turning themselves actively against immigrants.

So to sum up Germany isn't the perfect place to migrate to at all. Although living in Germany seem like a huge improvement, the path to get there is often paved with many insecurities, crime and suffrage.

I hope I could help you decide with your opinion on your friends plans and hope to write again soon.

greetings.


Felix
