The use of quotations in the text serves to capture a range of perspectives on the murder convictions of three white men for killing Ahmaud Arbery, reflecting a complex narrative around race relations in the United States. These quotations highlight the multifaceted reactions, from a sense of vindication and hope for justice to an acknowledgment of persisting racial divisions and inequalities.


> "“I was skeptical because of old history,” said the 65-year-old community activist, whose ancestors were auctioned as slaves in the port of Charleston, S.C., 130 miles up the Atlantic Coast. “But this is new history.”" 

 This quote encapsulates a personal perspective, illustrating skepticism rooted in historical experiences of slavery. The reference to "new history" suggests a cautious optimism, indicating a desire for positive change despite past traumas.

Here, the quotation offers a perspective on the broader racial divisions within the nation. It introduces the idea that the verdicts provide a small glimpse of hope for justice, indicating a potential path toward healing these divisions.

 The quotation showcases political responses to the incident, demonstrating condemnation from Republican leaders and legislative actions taken to address issues related to hate crimes and citizens' arrest laws.
 
> "“But this one stands out, because this is like a modern-day lynching from 400 years ago. To think that we were free of those times, and then for this to happen, it just kind of set me back mentally.”"

This poignant quote draws a powerful parallel between the contemporary incident and historical atrocities. It underscores the emotional toll of the event and challenges the notion of progress, prompting reflection on the persistence of deeply rooted issues.

> "“I just think it’s the right thing to do,” Kemp told a Savannah TV news outlet at the time. “What we saw in the Ahmaud Arbery case ... that’s not the state of Georgia I know. We’re better than that.”"
