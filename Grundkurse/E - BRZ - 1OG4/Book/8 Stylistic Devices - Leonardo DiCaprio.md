# Â Stylistic Devices - Leonardo DiCaprio
#### Analyse how language and stylistic devices are used to convince the audience

- **Repetition:** Phrases like "now is the time" and "no more" are repeated for emphasis.
- **Rhetorical Questions:** Questions like "which side of history will you be on?" challenge the audience to self-reflect and take action.
- **Vivid Imagery:** He uses descriptive language to paint a picture of the devastating effects of climate change, mentioning polluted cities, disappearing glaciers, and flooded lands.
- **Metaphor:** Climate change is compared to a "runaway freight train" to illustrate its accelerating pace and destructive potential.
- **Pathos:** He appeals to the audience's emotions by invoking fear ("terrified me") and shame ("the shame that each of us will carry").
- **Direct Address:** "You" is used repeatedly to connect with the audience and place the responsibility on them.
- **Analogy:** The tools to address climate change are presented as "in our hands."
- **Dichotomy:** He creates a clear contrast between inaction and taking action, highlighting the potential consequences of each choice.
