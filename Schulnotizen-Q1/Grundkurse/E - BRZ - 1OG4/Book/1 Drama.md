#### words
Tennessee Williams is regarded as one of the leading ==playwrights== of his time. His achievement in the field of drama was acclaimed by both critics and ==audience==. In his plays, the main character, also called the ==protagonist==, is often a lost individual who is displaced in society. Whereas most plays have acts, A Streetcar Named Desire is divided into 11 ==parts==, in which the action or the ==plot== develops. Like many plays, it contains some typical elements such as the ==expositions==, at the beginning, in which the conflict and the characters are introduced. This is followed by the ==rising== action, which results in a ==catastrophe==, in which the protagonist has to suffer. Unlike novels, which often have long descriptive passages, plays consist mainly of ==scenes== between two or more characters. The place where the action happens is called the ==setting==; in this case, it is New Orleans. When the play starts you will see the following on ==stage==: the ==scenery== (i.e. the painted backdrop, houses, etc.) and some ==props== (e.g. a table, a green lamp and a collapsible bed). Information concerning these elements can normally be found in the ==stage directions==, which also contain infromation on how the characters should speak their ==lines==. From the very beginning you see not only objects and people on the stage but you also hear music or other ==sounds==. One could say that the play has two levels, one visual and one ==aural==, which could also be called the sountrack of the play.
The ==director== is the person who coordinates the whole ==performance== and who has to transform the written text or ==script== into the three-dimensional world of the stage. In auditions he or she chooses the ==actors== and ==actresses== to play the various characters. He or she is also responsible for deciding on the scenery and costumes. During the ==rehearsels== which take place before the opening night, he or she discusss with the actors how they should play their ==dialogue==. Besides learning their lines, actors have to work on their ==articulation== (their way of speaking), their facial expressions and their ==gestures== (movements).
